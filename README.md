# Conducting the Job Interview: Structure of the Conversation and Types of Questions

The job interview is usually the first meeting between you and the candidate. Often, candidates are nervous. However, we aim to meet a relaxed candidate, as we don't want tense colleagues in the workplace. Therefore, it's important to make the candidate feel at ease and ensure the conversation is always amicable. We place great importance on the candidate experience.

## Structure of the Job Interview

You can structure the job interview as follows:

1. **Warm up and set the structure:** Don't start with questions right away, but allow both of you some time to warm up. Ask if the candidate found the location easily or if they would like a glass of water. If you're conducting an online interview, check if the connection is good and if the candidate can see everyone clearly. After warming up, frame the purpose of the conversation. Indicate the structure of the conversation and how much time you plan to spend.

2. **Ask questions about the CV and cover letter:** Review the candidate's application in advance and ask questions about their experiences with previous employers. Focus especially on aspects that stand out to you. It's not always necessary to discuss all experiences. For example, you can ask which experience the candidate thinks is most relevant for the position they are applying for. This way, you can see if they can limit themselves to the essentials while still gaining insight into their experiences. Other notable aspects include short periods of employment. It's interesting to ask why previous collaborations between the candidate and their former employer ended.

3. **Ask competency-based questions:** To discover the talents of your future colleague, it's best to ask open-ended questions. Focus on the candidate's past behavior. What have they done and how did they do it? Behavior from the past is a predictor of future behavior. Below is an overview of the types of questions that are suitable to ask during a job interview, as well as a list of competencies and the questions that can be used to assess these competencies.

### Suitable Questions for a Job Interview

- Open-ended questions, where the interviewee has the space to provide their own answer. Start questions with "how," "what," "which," "what makes," etc.
- Follow-up questions, where you delve deeper into what has been said. For example, "I'd like to go back to... what exactly did you mean by that?" or "You mentioned earlier that you... Can you tell me more about that?"
- Reflective questions, where the interviewer checks if they've understood correctly. For instance, "So, you're saying that..." or "If I understand you correctly, you think that..."
- STAR questions, where behavior predicts behavior. Ensure the candidate provides a concrete example by discussing the Situation, Task, Action, Result, and Reflection.

### Questions to Avoid During a Job Interview

- Hypothetical questions, which prompt a hypothetical answer.
- Leading questions, where the answer is suggested in the question itself.
- Either/or questions, which force the interviewee to choose between multiple options.
- Multiple questions asked at once, where only the last or easiest question gets answered.
- Closed questions, which can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no".

4. **Provide information about the position and entity:** The candidate is also there to gather information during a job interview. Therefore, explain the characteristics of the position, the conditions under which it is performed, and the main contacts the person will have. Be honest about the culture within your department and the context of your service, and dare to frame any difficulties.

5. **Allow the candidate to ask questions:** Answer the candidate's questions briefly and to the point. For questions about employment conditions (such as salary, insurance, etc.), refer to the HR department. Please always coordinate salary and start date with the selection advisor.

## Biases

When meeting candidates, you need to be extra cautious with mechanisms that make your assessment unreliable. We list the most common pitfalls (biases):

- Non-verbal bias: judging a candidate based on appearance, clothes, handshake, posture, etc.
- First impression bias: judging a candidate based on the first impression is not representative of the entire conversation.
- Contrast bias: when you see different candidates back-to-back, you can fall into the contrast trap.
- Halo effect: when one aspect of the candidate is so positive that it overshadows all other properties.
- Horn effect: when one aspect of the candidate is so negative that it overshadows all other properties.
- Anchoring bias: when you rely too much on a previous experience, preventing you from seeing the candidate's opportunities objectively.
- Similar-to-me effect: when you recognize your own characteristics in the candidate.

To counteract biases, you need to be very aware of your own pitfalls. When interviewing with a selection committee, point out biases to each other and be objective in assessing candidates.

## Assessing Candidates

Again, your pre-determined competencies come into play here. It's important that each member of the committee takes notes for each candidate individually. 
You should discuss each candidate's properties after you have met everyone. 
Sometimes it's very clear, and the entire committee has a definite preference for one candidate. 
When it's not as clear because you don't agree or because there are several good candidates, we can offer at least two suggestions.

## Additional Conversation
Sometimes it can help to invite the final candidates you are unsure about for an additional informal conversation. Often, the work environment is shown during this conversation, and candidates might meet future colleagues from the team. It mainly offers the candidate a chance to get to know a potential future work environment more calmly. We often receive feedback from committee members that the last informal conversation clarified many things. Afterwards, they can easily make a decision.

## Competency Matrix

Unfortunately, we don't always have time for an additional conversation. In such cases, a competency matrix can provide a solution. This can be done in various ways, but we provide a commonly used version here. 
The committee determined in advance that motivation, experience, the ability to work with others, decisiveness, and vision formation were the key properties to be screened for. Extra importance was attached to vision formation. You deemed these competencies necessary to perform the function properly. Motivation was seen as a second priority property, so both received an increased value. Then you assess how many "points" you give the candidates on the following properties. 
We use the following scale: 1 (barely present) - 2 (sufficiently present) - 3 (strongly present).

It's not intended to reduce candidates to a single score. This matrix can help when committee members disagree or when both candidates seem suitable. Discussing the matrix leads to new insights and makes you aware of potential biases. Ultimately, you decide with the committee whether you stand behind this outcome.

### Frequently Asked Questions: Detailed Responses

Below is an overview of the most frequently asked questions. If you have other inquiries, please contact the selection advisor who is assisting you with this vacancy.

#### Pre-Screening
**Q: I find it challenging to make a consistent judgment across all candidates. What can I do to improve this?**  
**A:** Review the criteria you're using to ensure they are clear and applicable based on resumes and cover letters. Clarify for yourself what the ideal candidate should embody, what is sufficient for the role, and what is insufficient. Consider employing a numerical scoring system to check for consistency across evaluations and revisit any outlier assessments.

**Q: What if a candidate doesn't have the required degree? How flexible can I be?**  
**A:** Refer back to your job posting to determine the strictness of the degree requirements. For instance, if the posting specifically requires a bachelor's degree in office management, only candidates with that degree qualify. If experience can substitute for the specified degree, you may include candidates with relevant job experience. The key is to apply these criteria consistently across all applications.

**Q: What if my candidate doesn't meet the asked years of relevant experience?**  
**A:** Revisit your job posting to understand how experience was framed. If it was described as a bonus, you might consider candidates who lack the specified experience, ensuring consistency in your approach. If specific years of experience were a firm requirement, this should be reflected in your evaluation. The context of the experience should also guide your assessment of the applications.

**Q: Can I take references?**  
**A:** Requesting references requires the candidate's consent due to GDPR regulations. Implicit consent is assumed if the candidate lists references in their resume or cover letter. Exercise caution when interpreting this information, considering its potential subjectivity and the evolving nature of individuals.

**Q: Can I use criteria not initially outlined in the job profile?**  
**A:** Stick to the requirements specified in the job profile to ensure fairness. Introducing new criteria post-hoc can unjustly disqualify candidates who might not have addressed these aspects in their applications due to their absence in the original job posting.

**Q: Is it necessary to follow all these steps?**  
**A:** Following a process that ensures objective evaluation is crucial, especially when new to pre-screenings. As you gain experience, some steps might become intuitive. However, involving multiple evaluators, setting clear criteria, and challenging each other's assessments can help mitigate bias and enhance objectivity.

**Q: Do I need to wait until the application period closes to start pre-screening?**  
**A:** You can begin assessing applications during the application period, but it's important to remain open to new submissions and give late applicants the same consideration as early ones.

**Q: I have a large pool of candidates and have selected enough for the first round. Can I hold the rest as reserves and only consider them if the first round doesn't yield a suitable candidate?**  
**A:** To ensure fair treatment, it's important to evaluate every application and include all candidates with comparable profiles in the selection process.

**Q: My top candidate applied on day one. Can I proceed with their candidacy and close the vacancy?**  
**A:** Fair treatment mandates that all applications are considered. Closing the vacancy prematurely could deny equal opportunities. You might, however, engage with promising early applicants to keep them interested in the position.

#### Interview
**Q: Do internal candidates have to go through the selection process?**  
**A:** Yes, to ensure fairness, both internal and external candidates must undergo the same selection process.

**Q: The candidate is suitable for the role but lives far away, causing me to hesitate.**  
**A:** Previous experiences with long commutes should not bias your decision. Engage in an open discussion with the candidate about their views on commuting. 

**Q: A candidate asked how they performed at the end of the interview. What should I say?**  
**A:** It's prudent to be cautious. Explain that you'll provide feedback after considering all candidates and discussing with your colleagues, emphasizing the importance of a fair process.

**Q: A candidate requests to reschedule the interview. Should I accommodate this?**  
**A:** If feasible and without compromising the fairness of the process, consider rescheduling. Ensure the new timing doesn't delay the overall selection process and maintain the same conditions as for other candidates.

**Q: A candidate wants the interview in a different language. Is this allowed?**  
**A:** This can be accommodated, but consider the language used in the workplace and discuss language proficiency with the candidate. For roles requiring specific language skills, ensure the candidate's proficiency meets the job requirements.

**Q: All candidates were invited in-person, but one can only attend online. Should I allow this?**  
**A:** Yes, but strive to keep the interview conditions as uniform as possible. Avoid conducting a group call with the

 selection committee; instead, each member should log in individually to ensure the candidate can clearly see and interact with everyone.

**Q: Can I customize the case study based on a candidate's talents or attributes?**  
**A:** The case study should be prepared in advance and aim to assess competencies critical for the role. If adjustments are necessary, they should be consistent across all candidates and relevant to the job.

**Q: My candidate didn't show up for the interview. What now?**  
**A:** You might reach out to reschedule, but if you've already identified a suitable candidate, note the absence, which results in a failed assessment for the no-show candidate.

**Q: I have two equally good candidates and can't decide.**  
**A:** Revisit your initial criteria. If there's a tie, an informal follow-up meeting might help, offering insights by introducing the candidates to the work environment and potential colleagues.

**Q: None of the interviewed candidates seem suitable.**  
**A:** It might be best to restart the selection process rather than settling for a candidate about whom you have reservations. Inform your selection advisor to discuss the next steps.

**Q: We found the ideal candidate, but their salary expectations exceed our pay scale.**  
**A:** Salary negotiations can be complex. First, consult your selection advisor. Then, transparently communicate the salary boundaries to the candidate, allowing them to reconsider their participation in the selection process. Consider the candidate's experience, which might justify a higher salary within your framework.
