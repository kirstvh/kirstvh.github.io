Hi, my name is Kirsten Van Huffel and I am a PhD student at the research unit KERMIT (Knowledge-based Systems, Ghent University, ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª). My main interest is harnessing the power of **machine learning to carry out constructive biology**. In particular, my goal is to leverage generative (energy-based) models for the combinatorial design of new molecules, proteins, genetic circuits or organisms.
